<p>Tarsiers are the only entirely carnivorous primates, preying on insects, lizards, and snakes. Clinging upright to trees,
     they press the tail against the trunk for support. Their grip is also aided by the tips of their digits, which are expanded
      into disklike adhesive pads. A species of tarsier endemic to the Philippines. It is found in the southeastern part of the archipelago, particularly on the islands of Bohol, Samar and Leyte.</p>
<p>But the Philippine Tarsier is near threatened. There are 5,000 to 10,000 Philippine Tarsiers left in the world. The Philippine
     tarsier is considered "Near Threatened" due to habitat loss and fragmentation, largely caused by deforestation for agriculture, logging, and mining. Additionally, the illegal pet trade,
      which involves capturing and selling tarsiers, and their use as tourist attractions also contribute to their declining population.
